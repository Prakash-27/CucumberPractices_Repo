What is the different between traditional software development process and BDD?
===============================================================================
-->In software engineering, behavior-driven development (BDD) is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project. It encourages teams to use conversation and concrete examples to formalize a shared understanding of how the application should behave. It emerged from test-driven development (TDD).

-->Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.

Traditional Development Process:
================================
i) Stakeholders tells Product owners/BA about Bussiness needs.

ii) Po/BA write the requirements.

iii) Dev Team starts writing the code. 

iv) Tester starts writing test cases.

v) Finish Product.

vi) Tech Writers will write a technical Document(DOC).


What is BDD -> Behaviour Driven Development: 
============================================
i) Stakeholders + PO/BA -> Talk about Bussiness Requirement more collaborately.

ii) PO + Dev + QA -> collaborate more around Requirement.

          ---> This three are Amigos.

iii) Agreed upon Requirement defined as English Formatted Scenarios 
 (Gherkin): GIVEN,WHEN,THEN... 
 using Examples 
 Requirements that matters 
 Ask Questions
 (why,How,What)
 Why we are using this feature.
 How could we achieve those 
 What are the Framework we are going to use.

iv) QA Team uses Scenarios for manual TCs

v) Developer uses Scenarios for Automates Tests.

vi) Automates Test Report generated against Features/Scenarios

vii) Finish Product.

Key Differences b/w TDD BDD ATDD:
=================================

Test Driven Development:
------------------------
1.Development centric Approach
2.UNIT Test (White Box Testing)
3.Write Test cases before code is written -> Author: Developer
Test First Approach
4.Key Focusb --> is my code working correctly?

TDD Cycle:
==========

  Write the Test Fails        Make the code works      Improve the code
1.---------------------->   2.------------------->   3.------------------>
        Test Fails                Test Passed               Refactor


Behaviour Driven Development:
-----------------------------
1.An Extension of TDD 
2.Works on higher level of abstraction as compared to TDD
3.Always ask --> Have we covered all the possible scenario's 
4.Test First Approach
5.Authors --> 3 Amigos (Product Owner/Developer/Quality Analyst)

BDD Cycle:
==========

   write failure feature/Scenario        Make the Test Pass        Improve the code
1.---------------------------------> 2.-----------------------> 3.------------------->
               Red Fail                      Pass                      Refactor


Acceptance Test Driven Development:
-----------------------------------
1.Higher level of Abstraction as compared to BDD/TDD
2.Focus on High level Requirements
3.Authors--> PO/BA/Bussiness
