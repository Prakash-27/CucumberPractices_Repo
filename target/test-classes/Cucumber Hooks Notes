Difference between hooks and background

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hooks are Setup & tearDown methods just like in TestNG/JUnit  

BACKGROUND -- SHOULD BE PART OF FEATURE FILE

CUCUMBER HOOKS: -- Technical Stakeholders 
===============
NOT PART OF FEATURE FILE
CAN BE WRITTEN IN STEP DEFINITION CLASS 
OR CAN BE WRITTEN IN A SEPERATE CONFIGURATION CLASS

1.Hooks are annotated with:
---------------------------

@Before -- will be executed before each scenario
@After -- will be executed after each scenario

@Before
setUp(){
Preconditions or Prerequesties like Initialize my Driver, Launch my Browser, Launch the URL, Delete the Cookies
} 

@After
TearDown(){
Close or Quit the Browser, Close the Database Connections
}

2.Another Cucumber Hooks:
-------------------------

@BeforeStep -- before each step in a feature file
@AfterStep -- After each step in a feature file


3.Multiple Before and After methods:
------------------------------------

@Before
m1(){
order = 1 (Launch my Browser)
}

@Before
m2(){
order = 2 (Database Connections)
}

@After
m1(){
order = 1 (close my Browser)
}

@After
m2(){
order = 2 (Disable Database Connections)
}
